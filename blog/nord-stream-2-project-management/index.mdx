This paper reviews the Nord Stream 2 pipeline project from the perspective of project management. By comparing the facts about the project with the best practices of managing a project, the report provides nine lessons the group has learned from Nord Stream 2â€™s examples. The topics of these lessons range from how their technical solutions could be improved to what techniques the project team should have used for better risk management.

This research project was done collaboratively by W. Cheng, A. Cui (Group Leader), Z. Yan, and N. Yang. Other than the [research paper](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Msf6aLE7xS1aCKXAapH2RfWKmm_iL_SM/view?usp=drive_link) itself, we also made a short [presentation video](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1lCBRK2DP15kNzYH3W11BMMMcniKGJK9A/view?usp=drive_link) that goes through the paper's contents as some readers might prefer.
