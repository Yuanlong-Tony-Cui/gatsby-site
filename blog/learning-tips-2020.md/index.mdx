1. Prioritize the application of theorems / methods over the derivation of them. (切忌本末倒置)
   
   Reasoning (i.e. knowing the procedures behind it) should only be a way to help students to better use the theorem or method, otherwise it will be extremely time-consuming and mislead students away from the true essence of engineering - applied science.

2. Start solving problems once knowing the basics of a concept. (切忌纸上谈兵)
   
   This is when students apply the concept and start to see different scenarios, which is closer to the real situations they will encounter in their future career.

3. Keep summarizing and connecting your knowledge to build enormous knowledge networks. (归纳总结，融会贯通)
   
   These two ways help students learn new knowledge faster, just like the mechanism of machine learning - the more knowledge it intakes, the smarter the AI would be.

4. Utilize supplementary resources. (多种方法，相辅相成)
   
   As a result of the fast development of the internet, it is not unusual for students to find a video online that explains a concept much more clear than their professor. YouTube videos, PDF textbooks and online articles tend to be increasingly useful tools that help university students understand various topics, especially in such pandemic time when professors become more undependable. Students should never reply on their professors only, but also all these resources that are available to them.
