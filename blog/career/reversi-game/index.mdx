This is an implementation using Rust of a classic board game called Reversi.

To try out this game, you could simply use `cargo build` and `cargo run` once you download the source file named `<main.rs>` (linked below). In case you need any clarifications on the game rules, a link like [this](https://cardgames.io/reversi/) might be helpful.

This project takes advantage of a few very handy features in Rust such as `enum` and `impl`, and it is more of a practice for me to better understand the concept of [ownership](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch04-01-what-is-ownership.html) in Rust.

Feel free to use my [source code](https://github.com/Yuanlong-Tony-Cui/rust-reversi) for a game or two, which has been made available on GitHub.
