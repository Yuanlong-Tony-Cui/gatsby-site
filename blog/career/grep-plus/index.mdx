This project is an advanced implementation in Rust of the well-known `grep` utility on Unix-like operating systems, which shows search results of a given keyword with supplementary features like keyword highlighting, case-insensitive search, and match details.

For example, if a user wants to search for the word "classifier" (in the context of NLP language models like [this](https://github.com/Yuanlong-Tony-Cui/sub-obj-classifier)) in all Markdown files (`*.md`) regardless of uppercase or lowercase (`-i`) with all matches highlighted (`-c`) and their locations displayed (`-f` and `-n`), they may run `cargo run classifier ./*.md -i -c -f -n`.
To explore the full functionalities of this search tool, you may use `cargo run --help` and read the instructions it gives.

The [code](https://github.com/Yuanlong-Tony-Cui/rust-grep-plus) was designed to take advantage of some key features in Rust such as lifetimes (e.g. using `'static`) and error handling (e.g. error boxing with `Box` and error propagation using `?`), and these are exactly some reasons why Rust is considered to be a more reliable choice than C or C++.
Some sample test files are already provided in the [source code](https://github.com/Yuanlong-Tony-Cui/rust-grep-plus) on GitHub, so feel free to try this utility out yourself!
