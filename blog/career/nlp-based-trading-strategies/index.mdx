The section Reviewing the Case Study provides a detailed review of Case Study 1 in Chapter 10, which is a news-based sentiment analysis method used for building trading strategies. This section analyzes different stages in the authors’ workflow, from data preprocessing to trading strategy making, and provides comments on which designs are good and what could be improved regarding the design itself and/or the readability.
