## 🧭 Student Club Explorer

**Student Club Explorer** is a Python-based tool that explores and extracts information about student clubs from the University of Toronto’s club directory. It extracts club details, contact info, interests, and more — with support for keyword-based filtering.

### 💡 Motivation

While working in an administrative role at the University of Toronto, my partner encountered a challenge: she needed to extract student club information — such as primary contact emails, origin campuses, and official website links — from the [Student Organization Portal (SOP)](https://sop.utoronto.ca/groups/). She asked if there were any existing tools that could help with this task.

After understanding the requirements and evaluating the available options, it became clear that building a lightweight, customized script would be faster and more flexible than relying on a general-purpose tool. That's how **Student Club Explorer** came to life — a tool built to automate and streamline this data collection process.

### 🔍 Intuition

The SOP provides a directory of student organizations, where each club is listed with a clickable name linking to its individual profile page. While the homepage displays basic information like the club name and campus, key details — such as the primary email address or external website — are only available on each club’s individual page.

Upon inspection, these profile pages follow a recognizable structure: for instance, the contact email consistently appears under a "Contact" heading and before the next section like "Address". These structural patterns make the site highly amenable to HTML parsing and automation, making a custom scraper both practical and efficient for collecting structured data at scale.

### 📌 Features

* 🔍 Scrapes club names, campuses, websites, emails, and interest tags
* 🌐 Follows each club’s individual profile page for deeper details
* 🧠 Filters clubs by interest keywords
* 📤 Exports clean, UTF-8 encoded CSV files
* ⏳ Displays a real-time progress bar using `tqdm`

### 🛠️ Technologies

* Python 3.11
* `requests` for HTTP requests
* `beautifulsoup4` for HTML parsing
* `tqdm` for progress bar
* `csv` for output formatting
