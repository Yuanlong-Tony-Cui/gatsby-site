This project is built to replicate cURL (client URL) with additional features like simplfied CLI inputs and formatted outputs.

Other than Rust-specific error handling, the implementation also uses RegEx extensively for input validation and employs widely used Rust crates such as `reqwest` and `structopt` for reliability.

The [source code](https://github.com/Yuanlong-Tony-Cui/curl-plus) and some key [use cases](https://github.com/Yuanlong-Tony-Cui/curl-plus?tab=readme-ov-file#example-use-cases) have been made available on GitHub. You may try it out to see whether you like this tool better than the original cURL!
