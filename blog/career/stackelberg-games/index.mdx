Abstract: This paper serves as the documented version of the tutorial-style presentation which covers Stackelberg games to students that know basic concepts of game theory. The paper is aimed to effectively deliver the key concepts of Stackelberg games while using relevant examples. It will start from pure strategy bi-matrix games and extend to continuous kernel games that resemble the Stackelberg Leadership Model.
