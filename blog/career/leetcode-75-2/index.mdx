This blog post aims to walk through classic coding problems listed in [LeetCode 75](https://leetcode.com/studyplan/leetcode-75/).

Topics covered in this post are: Linked List, Binary Tree (DFS and BFS), and Binary Search Tree (BST).

All solutions are written in Python and are optimized for performance and readability.

# Linked List

## 2095. Delete the Middle Node of a Linked List

```python
class Solution:
    def deleteMiddle(self, head: Optional[ListNode]) -> Optional[ListNode]:

        # Intuition:
        # We use a pointer to go through the linked list while using another pointer
        # that keeps track of the middle node between the head and current node.

        # Edge case: if the list has only one node, return None
        if not head.next:
            return None
        
        slow, fast = head, head
        pre_slow = None  # the previous node before `slow``
        
        # Use two-pointer technique to find the middle
        while fast and fast.next:  # ensures `fast.next.next` is safe to perform
            pre_slow = slow
            slow = slow.next
            fast = fast.next.next
        
        # Delete middle node:
        pre_slow.next = slow.next
        # In Python, `slow.next = None` is optional.

        # NOTE: In C++, we will have to do:
        # prev->next = curr->next;
        # curr->next = nullptr;  // optional. prevents accessing deleted memory.
        # delete curr;  # required. prevents memory leaks.
        
        return head
```

## 328. Odd Even Linked List

```python
class Solution:
    def oddEvenList(self, head: Optional[ListNode]) -> Optional[ListNode]:

        # Intuition: As we go through the linked list, we modify the node such that
        # odd nodes and even nodes are linked separately.

        if not head:
            return None
        
        number = 1
        curr = head
        prev_odd, prev_even = None, None
        even_head = None
        while curr:

            # Link odd nodes and even nodes separately:
            if number % 2 == 1:
                if prev_odd:
                    prev_odd.next = curr
                prev_odd = curr
            else:
                # Store the 1st even node:
                if number == 2:
                    even_head = curr
                if prev_even:
                    prev_even.next = curr
                prev_even = curr

            # Update:
            curr = curr.next
            number += 1
        
        # Append even nodes after all odd nodes:
        prev_odd.next = even_head

        # NOTE: We should make the latest even node (if any) point to None,
        # or the autotester will stuck in a loop:
        if prev_even:
            prev_even.next = None

        return head
```

## 206. Reverse Linked List

```python
class Solution:
    def reverseList(self, head: Optional[ListNode]) -> Optional[ListNode]:

        # Intuition:
        # 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4
        # 1 <- 2 -> 3 -> 4

        # base case (turns out to be handled by the code below):
        # if not head:
        #     return None
        
        curr_node = head
        prev_node = None
        while curr_node:
            next_node = curr_node.next  # "store"
            curr_node.next = prev_node  # "reverse"
            # update:
            prev_node = curr_node
            curr_node = next_node

        return prev_node  # when we exit the while loop, curr_node will be None.
```

## 2130. Maximum Twin Sum of a Linked List

```python
class Solution:
    def pairSum(self, head: Optional[ListNode]) -> int:
        
        # Intuition:
        # Since this is a linked list, not an array,
        # it is critical to identify all pairs of twins _as_ we traverse through the linked list.

        # Step 1: Find the middle node
        slow, fast = head, head
        while fast and fast.next:
            slow = slow.next
            fast = fast.next.next
        # `fast` is now at None at the very end of the linked list;
        # `slow` is now at the first node of the second half of the linked list.
        
        # Step 2: Reverse the second half starting from the middle node
        prev, curr = None, slow
        while curr:
            temp = curr.next  # store
            curr.next = prev  # swap
            prev = curr  # step
            curr = temp  # step
        # `prev` now points to the last node.

        # Step 3: Find the max twin sum
        max_sum = 0
        first, second = head, prev
        while second:
            max_sum = max(first.val + second.val, max_sum)  # update
            first = first.next
            second = second.next
        # `second` stops moving at Node (n/2 + 1) since its `next` points to None.

        return max_sum
```

# Binary Tree - DFS

## Maximum Depth of Binary Tree

```python
class Solution:
    def maxDepth(self, root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> int:

        # Intuition:
        # We run DFS to compute the depth by recursively calling maxDepth() on left & rigth subtrees.

        # Base case (we've reached the end nodes):
        if not root:
            return 0

        return max(
            self.maxDepth(root.left), self.maxDepth(root.right)
        ) + 1
```

## 872. Leaf-Similar Trees

```python
class Solution:
    def leafSimilar(self, root1: Optional[TreeNode], root2: Optional[TreeNode]) -> bool:

        # Intuition: Use pre-order DFS to find the leaf nodes.

        def dfs(node, seq):
            if not node:
                return
            if not node.left and not node.right:
                seq.append(node.val)
            dfs(node.left, seq)
            dfs(node.right, seq)

        seq1 = []
        seq2 = []
        dfs(root1, seq1)
        dfs(root2, seq2)

        return seq1 == seq2
```

## 1448. Count Good Nodes in Binary Tree

```python
class Solution:
    def goodNodes(self, root: TreeNode) -> int:
        
        # Intuition:
        # As we traverse the BST, store the max value seen so far,
        # and carry it in our recursive calls.

        good_nodes = []  # allows multiple writes at a time

        def isGoodNode(node: TreeNode, max_val: int):
            if not node:
                return False
            if node.val >= max_val:
                good_nodes.append(1)
                max_val = node.val
            isGoodNode(node.left, max_val)
            isGoodNode(node.right, max_val)
        
        isGoodNode(root, root.val)  # recursive calls inside

        return sum(good_nodes)
```

## 1448. Count Good Nodes in Binary Tree

```python
class Solution:
    def goodNodes(self, root: TreeNode) -> int:
        
        # Intuition:
        # As we traverse the BST, store the max value seen so far,
        # and carry it in our recursive calls.

        good_nodes = []  # allows multiple writes at a time

        def isGoodNode(node: TreeNode, max_val: int):
            if not node:
                return False
            if node.val >= max_val:
                good_nodes.append(1)
                max_val = node.val
            isGoodNode(node.left, max_val)
            isGoodNode(node.right, max_val)
        
        isGoodNode(root, root.val)  # recursive calls inside

        return sum(good_nodes)
```

## 437. Path Sum III

```python
class Solution:
    def pathSum(self, root: Optional[TreeNode], targetSum: int) -> int:

        # TODO

        # Helper function: DFS that carries the current sum
        def dfs(node, current_sum):
            if not node:
                return 0

            current_sum += node.val

            num_paths = prefix_sums.get(current_sum - targetSum, 0)

            prefix_sums[current_sum] = prefix_sums.get(current_sum, 0) + 1  # update

            # Recursive call on `left` and `right`:
            num_paths += dfs(node.left, current_sum)
            num_paths += dfs(node.right, current_sum)

            # Remove the current sum from the prefix sums when backtracking:
            prefix_sums[current_sum] -= 1

            return num_paths

        prefix_sums = {0: 1}  # Base case: A sum of zero is seen once

        return dfs(root, 0)
```

## 1372. Longest ZigZag Path in a Binary Tree

```python
class Solution:
    def longestZigZag(self, root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> int:

        # Intuition: Use DFS to recursively update the lengths of ZigZag paths.

        # `direction`: starting at the given `node`, where to go next
        def dfs(node, direction, length):
            if not node:
                return
            
            nonlocal max_length  # "pass by reference" for integers in Python
            max_length = max(max_length, length)
            
            if direction == "left":
                dfs(node.left, "right", length + 1)
                dfs(node.right, "left", 1)  # length reset to 1 since we are told to go "left" next but actually go "right" instead
            else:
                dfs(node.right, "left", length + 1)
                dfs(node.left, "right", 1)  # length reset to 1
    
        max_length = 0
        dfs(root.left, "right", 1)  # starts at `root.left`; should go right next; has a length of 1 from `root` to `root.left`
        dfs(root.right, "left", 1)
        return max_length
```

## 236. Lowest Common Ancestor of a Binary Tree

```python
class Solution:
    def lowestCommonAncestor(self, root: 'TreeNode', p: 'TreeNode', q: 'TreeNode') -> 'TreeNode':
        
        # Intuition:
        # By observation, we are able to identify the LCA of p and q only if:
        #   1) p and q are separately located in the left or right subtrees of a node
        #   2) p is an ancestor of q (or the other way around)

        # Base case 1: we've reached a leaf node
        if not root:  
            return None

        # Base case 2: Case 2, Intuition
        if root == p or root == q:  
            return root
        
        # Recursive calls:
        left = self.lowestCommonAncestor(root.left, p, q)
        right = self.lowestCommonAncestor(root.right, p, q)

        # Base case 3: Case 1, Intuition
        if left and right:
            return root

        # Base case 4: we keep searching in the left/right subtree
        return left if left else right
```

# Binary Tree - BFS

## 199. Binary Tree Right Side View

```python
class Solution:
    def rightSideView(self, root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> List[int]:

        # Intuition: The solution will be very similar to
        # [102. Binary Tree Level Order Traversal],
        # except that we only need to store the right-most node at each level.

        # Base case handling:
        if not root:
            return []

        queue = deque([root])
        result = []
        
        while queue:
            num_nodes = len(queue)  # takes a snapshot of the queue size
            # node_values = []  # all nodes at current level
            right_most_val = None

            # Pop until the original queue becomes empty:
            for _ in range(num_nodes):
                # 1. Visit:
                node = queue.popleft()  # breadth-first visiting
                # node_values.append(node.val)
                right_most_val = node.val
                # 2. Expand:
                if node.left:
                    queue.append(node.left)
                if node.right:
                    queue.append(node.right)
            
            # Store the right-most node at this level:
            # result.append(node_values[-1])
            result.append(right_most_val)

        return result
```

## 1161. Maximum Level Sum of a Binary Tree

```python
class Solution:
    def maxLevelSum(self, root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> int:

        # Intuition:
        # Since we need the sums of nodes _by level_, we run BFS using a FIFO queue (`deque`).

        queue = deque([root])
        max_sum = float('-inf')
        min_level = 1

        level = 1
        while queue:
            # Compute the level sum:
            level_sum = sum(node.val for node in queue)
            if level_sum > max_sum:
                max_sum = level_sum
                min_level = level

            # Get nodes of the next level:
            for _ in range(len(queue)):
                node = queue.popleft()
                if node.left:
                    queue.append(node.left)
                if node.right:
                    queue.append(node.right)
            level += 1

        return min_level
```

# Binary Search Tree

## 700. Search in a Binary Search Tree

```python
class Solution:
    def searchBST(self, root: Optional[TreeNode], val: int) -> Optional[TreeNode]:
        # Handle recursive calls on None:
        if not root:
            return None

        if val == root.val:
            return root  # base case
        elif val < root.val:
            return self.searchBST(root.left, val)  # search in the left subtree
        else:
            return self.searchBST(root.right, val)  # search in the right subtree
```

## 450. Delete Node in a BST

```python
class Solution:
    def deleteNode(self, root: Optional[TreeNode], key: int) -> Optional[TreeNode]:

        # Intuition:
        # Finding the node is easy, but when deleting it (if it has child nodes), we have to make sure the properties of BST still hold.

        if not root:
            return None

        # Search and delete:
        if key < root.val:  # search in the left subtree
            root.left = self.deleteNode(root.left, key)
        elif key > root.val:  # search in the right subtree
            root.right = self.deleteNode(root.right, key)
        else:  # delete the current node:

            # Case 1: No child or one child
            if not root.left:
                return root.right
            elif not root.right:
                return root.left

            # Case 2: The node has two children.

            # To maintain a BST, we should replace this node with the smallest in its right subtree.
            # Alternatively, we could also replace this node with the largest in its left subtree.

            smallest_right = self.getMin(root.right)
            root.val = smallest_right.val
            root.right = self.deleteNode(root.right, smallest_right.val)
            # We delete that smallest node in the right subtree by using a deleteNode() call.
        
        return root

    # getMin() returns the smallest node in a given BST
    def getMin(self, node: TreeNode) -> TreeNode:
        while node.left:
            node = node.left
        return node
```
