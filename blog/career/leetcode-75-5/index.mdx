This blog post aims to walk through classic coding problems listed in [LeetCode 75](https://leetcode.com/studyplan/leetcode-75/).

Topics covered in this post are: Backtracking, and Dynamic Programming (1D and Multidimensional).

All solutions are written in Python and are optimized for performance and readability.

# Backtracking
Backtracking problems often require a helper funtion `backtrack()` called in recursion that carries the following parameters:
1. What has been done
2. What still needs to be done
3. Other helper parameters

For this type of problems, we "backtrack" a solution when its _what has been done_ clearly doesn't satisfy a certain requirement.
For example, when we are building multiple n-element solutions that sum up to k,
we know a half-built solution definitely won't work when it has less than n elements but the sum already exceeds k.
We then backtrack from this solution by terminating that path immediately.

## 17. Letter Combinations of a Phone Number
```python
class Solution:
    def letterCombinations(self, digits: str) -> List[str]:

        # Intuition:
        # By using recursive calls, we are able to let each string of digits of length N explore its further possible strings (of length N+1).

        if not digits:
            return []
        
        phone_map = {
            "2": "abc", "3": "def", "4": "ghi", "5": "jkl",
            "6": "mno", "7": "pqrs", "8": "tuv", "9": "wxyz"
        }
        
        result = []
        # path: a list of letters built so far
        # index: `phone_map[digits[index]]` are potential letters to add
        def backtrack(path, index):
            # Base case: we've used all the digits
            if index == len(digits):
                result.append("".join(path))
                return
            # Recursion: consume one more digit
            for letter in phone_map[digits[index]]:
                backtrack(path + [letter], index + 1)
                
        backtrack([], 0)  # Start backtracking from index 0
        return result
```

## 216. Combination Sum III
```python
class Solution:
    def combinationSum3(self, k: int, n: int) -> List[List[int]]:

        # Key:
        # - Recursively call a function on the remaining sum to reach
        # - To avoid redundency (e.g. [1, 4, 7] vs [4, 1, 7]), we always start from lower numbers by using a `start` and updating it.
        # - To properly push a combination to `results`, we should push a copy of it using `list(comb)`. Otherwise, when `comb` gets modified later on, combinations in `results` will be changed too.

        results = []
        # comb: "what has been done"
        # target: "what is to be done"
        # start: avoids (1) same digit used more than once, (2) same combination with digits in different orders
        def backtrack(comb, target, start):
            if target == 0 and len(comb) == k:  # success
                results.append(list(comb))  # ***** appends a copy not a reference!
                return
            elif target < 0 or len(comb) == k:  # failure
                return
            
            # digit: [start, 9]
            for digit in range(start, 10):
                comb.append(digit)
                backtrack(comb, target - digit, digit + 1)
                comb.pop()  # backtracks

        backtrack([], n, 1)
        return results
```
