Have you ever wondered why building software apps can be so profitable? One classic revenue model is advertisement - App Builders are able to make money by helping Merchants to market their products to the App Users through something called “push ads”, which are selected by ad-pushing algorithms.

Traditionally, the performance of an ad-pushing algorithm is measured by having human raters evaluate the push ads – the more appealing the pushed ads are, the more effective the ad-pushing algorithm is. However, this human-based process can be expensive, time-consuming, and prone to human mistakes and errors.

Therefore, the goal of our project, AdVize, is to build a tool for App Builders to more efficiently evaluate the performance of their ad-pushing algorithms, reducing their reliance on human raters.
