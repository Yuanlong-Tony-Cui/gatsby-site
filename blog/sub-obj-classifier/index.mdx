Subjective / Objective Statement Classifier is a tool that uses language models in NLP to determine if a particular statement (a sentence) is subjective or objective.

Earlier this year (July 2024), I did some research on using NLP to skim through the news articles to build investment strategies on the stock market (as shown on my website). A few questions that came up in my mind almost immediately are:

1. How do I know if the information in online articles is correctly and accurately reflects the facts?
2. Would it be helpful to have a tool that helps us examine an article is trustworthy especially in the big information era when people get to post their opinions on social media?
3. What would be an efficient way to determine whether an article is trustworthy or not?

The third question eventually motivated me to build a helper tool that classifies a piece of text to "subjective" or "objective," and I believe its classification results would make it easier to filter the massive information before directly using it for any analytical tasks.

You are welcome to take a closer look at this [GitHub repository] (https://github.com/Yuanlong-Tony-Cui/sub-obj-classifier) of mine if you want to try it out yourself.
