We as computer science students have written a number of applications and system software tools (e.g. an OS kernel) through university courses and extracurricular projects. Therefore, writing another general-purpose application was not appealing to us for this Rust-based project. Among the entire technology stack that makes a computer work, how compilers do their work was still somewhat of a mystery to us, so we wanted to create one from the ground up and tackle this last remaining puzzle piece. Since the team members all have a passion for programming languages, we wanted to experiment with designing a new programming language for developers.

For this project, we set out to design our own programming language and write a language-specific IDE for its developers, which include a code editor and a compiler. This is an interesting project that allowed us to dive into the more arcane world of language design, and we took this opportunity to come up with a new language that we call "Fnland" with a number of properties that isnâ€™t available in many of the more popular languages. The Fnland IDE, named "FnIde", creates a tool for Fnland developers to more easily write Fnland code. For the compiler which is available in both CLI (command-line interface) and FnIde, we chose to make JavaScript as the compiled output due to its expressive syntax, feature-rich runtime, and reflective properties, which relieves us from the time-consuming process of implementing complex runtime infrastructure like memory management, allowing us to complete the project within a limited time frame.

Although the source code is made private on GitHub, the [README](https://github.com/Yuanlong-Tony-Cui/fnide-public) is available with demos of key features. If the idea interests you, please contact the authors for access to the private repository.
