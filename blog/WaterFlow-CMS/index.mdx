WaterFlow is a course management system (CMS) built for both administrators and students.
On WaterFlow, the admin could add / edit / remove courses, while the students could register / drop courses and view their weekly schedule.

The entire web application was written in TypeScript, which had made it much easier for me to debug.
I built the [front end](https://github.com/Yuanlong-Tony-Cui/WaterFlow-Front-End) using Vue and Tailwind CSS and the [backend](https://github.com/Yuanlong-Tony-Cui/WaterFlow-Backend) using Express.js and MongoDB.

I first started my career as a software engineer in 2019 using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js),
and since then React has been my go-to framework / library for front end development.
Although in the past I did work on a few industrial-grade Vue applications as an intern by collaborating with other senior developers,
this project is really the first Vue application that I built all by myself.

Compared to React (MVC), I really love the two-way data binding mechanism in Vue (MVVM), where data in View and Model is always synchronized and I no longer need to manually update states.
Based on my observations on the current job market in 2025, however, React is still the "mainstream" front end framework / library, at least in North America.
However, as a React developer for many years, my experience with Vue through this project was quite refreshing and smoother than I thought.
I think I might consider using Vue for my next web application project.
