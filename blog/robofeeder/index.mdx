The RoboFeeder is a system designed to help people with disabilities to have meals more easily without moving their arms or upper body.

This system primarily comprises a robotic arm with a built-in gripper and an RGBD camera. Knowing what food the user wants through linguistic inputs, the system will then search for the target food on the table using computer vision, use a fork to skewer it, locate and then deliver the food to the userâ€™s mouth.

Visit RoboFeeder's [website](https://yuanlong-tony-cui.github.io/Blog-Homepage/) for how we built this project from scratch.
