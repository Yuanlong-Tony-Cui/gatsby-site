There is a growing trend towards purchasing used cars, however, the traditional method such as using standard depreciation models often fall short in capturing the key factors that impact a used carâ€™s value. In this project, we introduce a different approach to used-car price prediction, distinct from the traditional existing methods. Our approach combines both
machine learning algorithms and regression techniques. The primary goal is to provide a reliable tool for assisting automobile customers with limited budgets in making well-informed decisions when purchasing pre-owned vehicles.
